              <h2>Categories of Personal Data Processed by SLIMiot</h2>

              <h3>Personal data that is processed when you create a SLIMiot account:</h3>
              <p>When you create a SLIMiot account, we ask you to provide your email address and name. You can choose to provide only your first name or a nickname instead of your full name if you wish.</p>

              <h3>Purposes and legal Grounds:</h3>
              <p><strong>(a)</strong> SLIMiot processes your email address because you use your email address and your password to sign in to your account. The legal ground for processing your email address for this purpose is based on SLIMiot's legitimate interest in protecting the security of your account.</p>

              <p><strong>(b)</strong> SLIMiot also processes your email address for the purpose of sending you important information about your SLIMiot products, apps or account, such as important safety information or material changes to this Privacy Policy. The name you provide is associated with your account profile, and is displayed when you submit comments or other material on a SLIMiot website or app. The legal ground for processing your email address and name for these purposes is SLIMiot's legitimate interest in providing you important safety or other information about your SLIMiot products, apps or account or material changes to this Privacy Policy, and in providing you an opportunity to engage with other SLIMiot users.</p>

              <p><strong>(c)</strong> If you provide your opt-in consent to receiving marketing information from SLIMiot, SLIMiot will also process your email address for the purpose of sending you marketing information about SLIMiot products and apps. The legal ground for processing your email address for this purpose is your consent. You may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your preferences in your SLIMiot account or through the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our marketing emails. The marketing emails you receive from SLIMiot are based on the preferences you provide in your SLIMiot account, the locale indicated by your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the types of SLIMiot devices you have added to your SLIMiot account, and any subscriptions included in your SLIMiot account. The legal ground for processing this data for this purpose is SLIMiot's legitimate interest in reducing the number of marketing emails sent to each particular customer by selecting which customers receive a particular marketing email rather than sending every marketing email to every customer who has consented to receiving marketing emails.</p>

              <p><strong>(d)</strong> SLIMiot also processes your email address to associate it with your SLIMiot account when you interact with our customer support representatives. The legal ground for this processing is our legitimate interest in providing quality customer support.</p>
            </div>

              <h2>Personal data that is processed when you sign in to your SLIMiot account with Social Media Credentials if you choose:</h2>
              <p>You may choose to sign in to your SLIMiot account using your social media sign in credentials (e.g., your Facebook sign in credentials). If you choose to do this, the first time you do so you will be asked whether you agree that the social media provider may provide certain information to SLIMiot, such as your name, email address, profile photo, posts, comments and other information associated with your social media account.</p>
              <p>All of this information is made available to SLIMiot by the social media provider due to the way the social sign-on configuration works. However, the only information SLIMiot retains and processes is your email address. If you do not want your information to be shared with SLIMiot by the social media provider, then you can simply sign in to your SLIMiot account using your SLIMiot account credentials instead of your social media account credentials.</p>

              <h3>Purposes and legal Grounds:</h3>
              <p>SLIMiot associates the email address provided by the social media provider with your SLIMiot account so that you can use your email address to sign in to your SLIMiot account in the future if you no longer wish to sign in using your social media account credentials. The legal ground for processing this information for this purpose is SLIMiot's legitimate interest in providing you an alternative sign in method and in securing your account.</p>
